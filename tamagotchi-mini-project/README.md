# Tamagotchi Mini-Project

### Description

Let's use our front-end web development skills to create a "living" pet! We'll use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with our pet.

### Requirements

* You must have a class for your Tamagotchi, a `game` object or class, and event listeners/handlers that call methods in your `game` object or class.  

* Your application must be deployed on Github Pages. There will be a demo on how to deploy to Github Pages next week. If you want to try before then, check out this [resource](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).

* You must build incrementally and make commits as you go. You will be expected to show a commit history that reflects taking careful measured steps and building one feature at a time.

* Create a repo for your Tamagotchi pet on [github.com](https://github.com/) **NOT** on github enterprise.

* **Make a commit after you finish each of the following**
* Create a Class (look at your notes on [JS Classes](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-chi-anemone/student-resources/blob/main/1_front_end_development/w03d02/instructor_notes/1_classes.md) if you forgot) for your Tamagotchi
* Instantiate your Tamagotchi
* Display a character of your choice on the screen to represent your pet
* Display the following metrics for your pet:
  * Hunger (1-10 scale)
  * Sleepiness (1-10 scale)
  * Boredom (1-10 scale)
  * Age
* Add buttons to the screen to feed your pet, turn off the lights, and play with your pet.
* Add the ability to name your pet.
* Style the page.
* Increase your pet's age every x minutes
* Increase your pet's Hunger, Sleepiness, and Bored metrics on an interval of your choosing.
* You pet should die if Hunger, Boredom, or Sleepiness hits 10.
* Morph your pet at certain ages.
* Animate your pet across the screen while it's alive.

### Extras
* Have your Tamagotchi give birth to baby Tamagotchi...
* ...with special powers (extend the class)!
* Add an `exercise()` method to your Tamagotchi, that affects certain properties
* Add anything you can think of... use your imagination!
